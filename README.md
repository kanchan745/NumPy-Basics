# NumPy-Basics
NumPy basics revision using Google colab.
🧮

This repository contains my revision notes and practice work on NumPy.
I revised the fundamentals using Google Colab to strengthen my Python
and Data Science basics.

 What I Practiced
- Introduction to NumPy
- Creating NumPy arrays
- 1D and 2D arrays
- zeros(), ones(), full()
- arange()
- Identity matrix using eye()
- Mean calculation using NumPy

Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Google Colab

Why this Repository?
I created this repository to revise NumPy concepts and build a strong
foundation for Data Science and Machine Learning.

Learning Outcome
This practice helped me understand how NumPy works internally and how
arrays are used for numerical computations in Python.
